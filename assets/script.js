// Global variables
// Current city
// This week
// Weather Array=[Sunny, Overcast, Rain, Snow, Windy,]

// When the page loads search localStorage to see last city viewed and view it's stats + list up to 5(?) past searches. If nothing in localStorage view basic page format or set a city as a default? 

// View current date (DD/MM/YYYY)

// When city is searched run weather API (does it have everything for the map side of things too?)

// Display in main frame (think jumbotron) the city name/date/current day's weather (temperature/humidity/wind speed/UV index)

// In 5 day cards display next days in order of proper sequence {card1/card2/card3/card4/card5} correct image/date (DD/MM/YYYY)/temperature/humidity
